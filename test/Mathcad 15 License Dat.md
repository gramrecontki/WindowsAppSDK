Mathcad 15 is a powerful software for engineering calculations and documentation. However, to use it, you need to have a valid license file. A license file is a text file that contains information about your Mathcad 15 subscription, such as the expiration date and the number of users. If you have purchased Mathcad 15 from PTC or an authorized reseller, you should have received a license file by email or on a CD-ROM. If you have not received your license file, please contact PTC customer support or your reseller.
 
Applying a license file in Mathcad 15 is easy and can be done in a few steps. Here is how:
 
**Download File ⇔ [https://vercupalo.blogspot.com/?d=2uCfCv](https://vercupalo.blogspot.com/?d=2uCfCv)**


 
1. Browse to the `c:\Program Files\Mathcad\Mathcad 15\Licenses` directory and rename the file `license.dat` to `license.bak`. This will backup your existing license file in case you need it later.
2. Launch Mathcad. The *Mathcad License Setup* wizard will appear. If it does not, open a command prompt (usually Start &gt; Runâ¦ &gt;cmd) and type `c:\Program Files\Mathcad\Mathcad 15\mathcad.exe /license`.
3. On the first page of the wizard, choose the second option saying *I want to configure Mathcad to use an existing license file*.
4. On the next page, click on the button with the three dots and browse for your license file. It may have a different extension than `.dat`, such as `.lic` or `.txt`. In that case, select to look for *All Files (\*.\*)*.
5. After finding your license file, click Next.
6. Click Finish and you're done.

Then start Mathcad 15 to see that it worked. You should be able to use Mathcad 15 without any problems until your license expires. If you need to renew your license or purchase a new one, please visit PTC's website or contact your reseller.
